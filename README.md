# hello-world
A brief introduction

I am geoscientist with about 12 years of experience in geology and spatial data science. I do not have a computer science background (I am working on it). Several years ago I became interested in leveraging computers to do some of the common repetitive subsurface interpretation tasks. This interest has evolved and I am now exploring solutions to subsurface interpretation problems with Machine Learning. I look forward to being part of the GitHub community!
